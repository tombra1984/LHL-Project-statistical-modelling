PROJECT GOALS

The goal of the project was to combine, practice and implement skill sets obtained thus far. From accessing data using API's, cleaning and loading data, to interpreting statistical results and modelling.

Process

The project followed the following process

Access and retrieve data using APIs, Cleaning and transforming the data in Python, Loading data into a database using Python, Performing EDA, statistical analysis and visualizations, Identifying trends and patterns in data using statistical models and interpreting the results of the statistical models

Results

The Foursquare API had more locations and information associated with each location. As opposed to Yelp API which had limited number of locations and not much tags associated with them. This impacted the final model as more information would have produced a better model

Challenges

There were businesses that had variations of their names in both API's but had the same location. Sorting through POI's and making sure they were no duplicates was challenging. The different call times for the API's was also an issue.

Future Goals

Get a more robust data set.
